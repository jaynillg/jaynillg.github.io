    <p> Hi I'm Jaynill  <br> <br>
      I am studying BSc Computer Science at the University of Pretoria. 
      I've been studying BSc CS since half way through 2016 and before that I was studying BSc. Physics since 2015.  <br> <br>
      I am a hard worker and eager for a challenge, any problem that I see is a puzzle for me to solve.
      I am a quick learner and love to learn new skills on the job, once I've learnt a new skill I will always find a way to use that skill 
      <br>

      I would like to hopefully further my study in Educational computing or a similar field. 
      Education and learning has always beena passion of mine, and I help out with IT classes at the High School that I attended when I was younger.
      I hope to one day obtain a PhD in Computer Science and contribute to that field 
      <br> <br>
